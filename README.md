scapy-bacnet
============

A BACnet layer for [Scapy](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/).

Currently only the BLVC, NPDU and APDU layers are partially implemented.


Getting started
---------------

After [getting a Scapy installation running](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/installation.html) refer to the [tests](https://github.com/desolat/scapy-bacnet/blob/master/scapy_bacnet/test/test_bacnet.py) for an integration example.
