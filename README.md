Currently only the BLVC and NPDU layers are implemented.


Getting started

After [getting a Scapy installation running](http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/doc/installation.html) refer to the [tests](https://github.com/desolat/scapy-bacnet/blob/master/tests/test_bacnet.py) for an integration example.
